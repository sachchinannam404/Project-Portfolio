# Zava AI Project Portfolio Agent

## Summary

Zava demonstrates intent-driven UX inside Microsoft Copilot. Thirty independently routed
operational Copilot Components answer personal delivery, project, portfolio, AI investment, capacity,
submission, and approval intents. A catalog-driven capability explorer helps users discover them.

Inline dynamic UX is the primary experience: a project-health question renders evidence, a comparison
renders aligned trade-offs, and a request renders an editable review flow. Operational components can
expand into a shared full-screen workspace with **My Work**, **Project**, **Portfolio**, and
**Decisions** dashboards. All data and confirmed actions are deterministic, offline, and sample-only.

For a live presentation, use the timed
[3-minute dynamic UX demo](Zava-Project-Tracker-3-Minute-Demo.md). For routing, extraction, and UX
testing, use the complete [31-component prompt catalog](Zava-Project-Tracker-Demo-Prompts.md).

## Used SharePoint Framework Version

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.24.0--beta.2-yellow.svg)

This sample targets the SPFx `1.24.0-beta.2` Copilot Component preview used by the repository. Confirm
the supported SPFx Copilot component version in your target tenant before production adoption.

## Applies to

- [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx)
- [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant)

> Get your own free development tenant by subscribing to [Microsoft 365 developer program](http://aka.ms/o365devprogram)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.14.0 <23.0.0` for local development.
- A SharePoint app catalog and Microsoft Copilot access for deployment and tenant-host validation.
- No external API, Azure resource, or runtime network dependency is required for the sample data.
- For local Workbench testing, replace `{tenantDomain}` in `config/serve.json` with the target tenant
  domain. The ready-made package does not require this local development setting.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Deploy the ready-made package from
  [`sharepoint/solution/zava-project-tracker.sppkg`](sharepoint/solution/zava-project-tracker.sppkg)
  to the tenant app catalog, or build locally:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```

- For local development, configure the tenant domain in `config/serve.json`, then run:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Add the generated Zava agent to Microsoft Copilot and start with one of the three conversation
  starters. Use the prompt catalog for deterministic routing checks.

### Video: test the package in Microsoft 365

Use this walkthrough to deploy and test SPFx Copilot component `.sppkg` packages in a Microsoft 365
tenant:

[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4asOZi4PNUQ)

The ready-made package is intended for sample/demo tenants. Build from source and complete your own
tenant, accessibility, privacy, localization, and security validation before production use.

Other build commands can be listed using `heft --help`.

## Features

- 30 purpose-designed operational Copilot Components and one capability explorer.
- Information, review/decision, and request/submit operation models.
- Shared responsive full-screen shell with four useful default dashboards.
- Explicit Draft -> Review -> Confirm -> session receipt workflows.
- Typed invocation versioning and supported inline-to-full-screen context continuation.
- Deterministic mock project/portfolio data, bundled personas, and no external writes.
- Fluent UI v9, React 17, Griffel owner-document styling, and focused D3 visualizations.
- Tenant-free UX review harness with responsive, dark, reduced-motion, and zoom evidence.
- Optimized shared production bundle with generated plugin and package-output validation.

## Data and safety

- Projects, people, financials, capacity, AI usage, risks, and approvals are deterministic mock data.
- Megan Bowen, Pradeep Gupta, and other named people are standard fictional Microsoft 365 demo personas.
- Prompt values prefill or filter UX but never submit, approve, reject, assign, or write automatically.
- Confirmed sample actions persist only in browser-session state and can be reset from Decisions.
- No live Graph, SharePoint, Planner, Project, Fabric, finance, or AI-service call is made at runtime.

## Accessibility and responsive design

- Keyboard-accessible tabs, forms, queues, controls, and icon-button names.
- Visible text/icon semantics accompany status colors.
- Reduced-motion behavior and real 200% browser zoom validated in the tenant-free review harness.
- Inline layouts validated at 340 px and 760 px; full-screen dashboards validated from 340 px through
  keynote width in light and dark themes.
- Charts provide accessible names and nearby textual insight. Additional table/list equivalents and
  authenticated-host screen-reader/high-contrast validation remain tracked in [todo.md](todo.md).

## Worldwide readiness

- Currency display supports USD, EUR, and JPY in the full-screen session settings.
- Layouts are designed for narrow and wide hosts without viewport-scaled typography.
- Authored UI and localization resources are currently English (US). Full translation, right-to-left
  presentation, locale-specific week starts, and final worldwide stress testing are documented
  follow-ups rather than implied completed capabilities.

## Validation status

- `168/168` tests pass with zero build warnings.
- All 31 manifests, tools, schemas, registrations, and 188 optional prompt properties validate.
- The generated API plugin and final `.sppkg` pass automated output audits.
- All 39 unified-gallery screenshots are validated against `assets/sample.json`.
- Tenant-authenticated CSP, iframe focus, screen-reader, and high-contrast smoke testing requires a
  configured tenant and remains an explicit external validation step.

## Demo and testing

- [3-minute dynamic UX demo](Zava-Project-Tracker-3-Minute-Demo.md) - concise keynote showing three
  intent-routed inline experiences and one governed Decisions continuation.
- [10-minute business value demo](Zava-Project-Tracker-10-Minute-Business-Demo.md) - comprehensive
  leadership story across discovery, project evidence, portfolio trade-offs, personal work, and a
  confirmed session decision.
- [5-minute developer and architecture demo](Zava-Project-Tracker-5-Minute-Technical-Demo.md) - pairs
  live UX with the exact routing, host, state, theming, session-store, bundling, and validation code.
- [31-component demo prompt catalog](Zava-Project-Tracker-Demo-Prompts.md)
- [Unified sample gallery metadata](assets/sample.json)
- [Experience and implementation plan](todo.md)
- [Reusable agentic creation rules](agentic-creation-rules.md)
