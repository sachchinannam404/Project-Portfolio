# Zava AI Project Portfolio Agent demo prompts

Use this catalog to test tool selection, property extraction, inline UX, and full-screen landing in Microsoft Copilot. Start a new conversation for routing-collision tests. Each prompt should select exactly one Copilot Component.

> Expected properties are normalized business values, not guaranteed diagnostic formatting. Missing fields remain visible defaults or selectors. By design, this sample uses prompt values to prefill, filter, or open a decision draft, while submission, approval, rejection, assignment, and external writes require separate governed actions. Megan Bowen, Pradeep Gupta, Customer Service Copilot, and the other named people/projects are
> deterministic fictional sample records. The prompts intentionally use them so routing and screenshots
> remain reproducible in every demo tenant.

## Meaningful interaction checklist

Use one interaction after each routing smoke test when time permits:

- `GetMyWorkSummary`: change **Priority filter**.
- `GetMyTasks`: change grouping and toggle **Blocked only**.
- `GetMyCapacity`: switch **Committed / Forecast**.
- `GetMyGoalContributions`: change objective and toggle **Include indirect**.
- `GetProjectHealth`: change health focus.
- `GetProjectTimeline` / `GetProjectMilestones`: toggle **Critical only**.
- `GetProjectRisks`: select a risk cell.
- `GetProjectBudget` / `GetPortfolioBudgetForecast`: change scenario and toggle **Variance only**.
- `GetProjectAiSpend`: change period and grouping.
- `CompareProjects`: change comparison dimension.
- `GetPortfolioHealth`: change phase/risk filtering and select a bubble.
- `GetStrategicAlignment`: toggle **Include unaligned**.
- `GetPortfolioAiSpend`: change metric and toggle **By model**.
- `GetPortfolioRiskExposure`: toggle **Dependencies**.
- Reviews: select **Review**, inspect safeguards, and stop before confirmation unless testing receipts.
- Submissions: edit one field, select Review, verify the changed value, and stop before confirmation unless testing receipts.
- Explorer: search, filter, copy a prompt, and inspect a safe preview.

## Routing collision checks

Start a fresh conversation for each pair.

- **How much project budget remains?** -> `GetProjectBudget`; **Request another $75k of AI budget** -> `RequestAiBudget`; **Review the $75k budget request** -> `ReviewProjectBudget`.
- **Show AI spend** -> `GetProjectAiSpend` or `GetPortfolioAiSpend`; **Record AI usage** -> `SubmitAiUsage`.
- **Show my capacity** -> `GetMyCapacity`; **Show project team capacity** -> `GetProjectTeamCapacity`; **Show portfolio capacity gaps** -> `GetPortfolioCapacity`; **Can Pradeep join at 20%?** -> `ReviewResourceAssignment`.
- **Start a project request** -> `SubmitProjectRequest`; **Review project request PRQ-2606** -> `ReviewProjectRequest`.
- **Show project health** -> `GetProjectHealth`; **Is the project ready to exit pilot?** -> `ReviewStageGate`.
- **Compare two projects** -> `CompareProjects`; **Compare this month with last month for one project** -> the owning single-project metric component.
- **What needs my attention?** -> `GetMyWorkSummary`; **What decisions need me?** -> `GetApprovalInbox`.
- **What can this agent do?** -> `ExploreAgentCapabilities`; it must not return a long technical tool list in chat.

## Safe action checks

- This sample is configured so prompt text does not submit or confirm automatically.
- Return and Reject require visible rationale before confirmation.
- Blocked stage-gate approval remains disabled.
- The **Approve** action remains disabled for overloaded resource scenarios until allocation is safe.
- Receipts state that no external system was updated.
- Confirmed generic submissions and review decisions persist only in browser-session sample state.
- **Reset demo decisions** clears processed Decisions state.

## Test recording template

For each prompt, record:

1. Selected tool name.
2. Extracted properties shown in Copilot diagnostics, if available.
3. Visible inline layout and one meaningful interaction.
4. Full-screen workspace and route.
5. Whether a fresh prompt resets prompt-derived defaults.
6. Whether any transient state shown in full screen matches the supported continuation contract.
7. Runtime errors, overflow, missing images, unlabeled controls, or blank charts.
